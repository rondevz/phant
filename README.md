# README

## About

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config

## Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails3 dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails3 build`.

## Current Status (2026-03-03)

- CLI dump capture is stable for `dump()` and `dd()` with one event per call.
- Hook installer rewrites user prepend script at `~/.config/phant/php/phant_prepend.php` and configures CLI via `99-phant.ini` when available.
- Valet Linux verification panel now reports FPM service wiring, active/enabled state, and recommended remediation commands.
- Valet Linux panel includes guarded remediation apply flow (explicit confirmation required) to write FPM `99-phant.ini` and attempt service restarts.
- Linux priority is now expanding from CLI-only verification to Valet Linux / FPM service boundary verification.
